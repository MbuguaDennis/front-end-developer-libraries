Bootstrap assists building responsive websites. It includes classes to style buttons, images, forms, navigation, and other common elements.
- JQUERY
Query is one of the most widely used JavaScript libraries in the world.

In 2006 when it was released, all major browsers handled JavaScript slightly differently. jQuery simplified the process of writing client-side JavaScript, and also ensured that your code worked the same way in all browsers.

In this course, you'll learn how to use jQuery to select, remove, clone, and modify different elements on the page.
